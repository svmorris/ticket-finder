A program to monitor ticket re-selling websites
===============================================

On some concerts re-sale tickets get sold even before the email notification can arrive. I don't know how people do that, but I hope this bot helps.

The goal of the bot is to monitor for new tickets on *some* popular ticket re-sale websites and quickly alert you if there is a new one. Currently I'm hoping to do that via discord notification as that is instant, but might add something else in the future.


#### Disclaimer
Please do not use this bot if you are only buying the ticket to re-sell it for a higher price somewhere else.



## Usage

For the twicket.live website:
```
ticket-finder twicket <event_id> <discord_id>
```
**Note:** The `event_id` of a concert can be found at the end of the URL.
**Note 1:** Your `discord_id` can be found by right clicking on your name in any chat. Its usually around 18 decimal numbers.
